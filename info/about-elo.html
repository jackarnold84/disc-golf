<p>
  The Elo rating system is a popular method for calculating relative skill levels
  among players based on head-to-head matchups.
  <br><br>
  The higher Elo player one beats, the more points they will gain for a win (vice versa
  for a loss).
  <br><br>
  With the current parameters:
  <ul>
    <li>+100 point separation = 82% win probability</li>
    <li>+50 point separation = 68% win probability</li>
    <li>+0 point separation = 50% win probability</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Players will gain between 0 to 6 points for a win depending on the point separation
  of their opponent.
  <br><br>
  Important Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Elo is zero sum, meaning all points gained in a win are taken from the losing
    opponent</li>
    <li>As a result, Elo does not measure group improvement, but only how strong
      players are relative to each other</li>
  </ul>
